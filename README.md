## 🧪 How It Works

1. When you open a new tab and navigate to any site, the extension parses the current DOM.
2. It collects:
   - `<a href>`
   - `<script src>`
   - `<link href>`
   - XHR/fetch requests (where possible)
3. It filters, de-duplicates, and shows a neat list in the popup.
4. Click any URL to open it in a **new tab**.
5. Use the search bar to quickly find endpoints by keywords like `login`, `api`, `user`, etc.
